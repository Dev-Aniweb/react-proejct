# Learning React 🚀



This project is created to learn and practice some important React concepts with simple examples.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered (With Basic Definitions)

### 🔹 React Router
React Router is a library that helps us navigate between different pages (components) in a React application **without reloading the page**.

### 🔹 Lazy Loading
Lazy loading is a technique used to **load components only when they are needed**, which helps improve application performance and reduce initial load time.

### 🔹 Prop Drilling
Prop drilling happens when data is passed from a parent component to deeply nested child components through multiple layers of props.

### 🔹 Context API (Basic)
The Context API is used to **share data globally** across components without passing props manually at every level.  
It helps solve the problem of prop drilling.
