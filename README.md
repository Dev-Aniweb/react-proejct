## **About Me**
I am learning **React.js** and building small projects daily to understand:

- Components & Props  
- State & Lifecycle  
- React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, etc.)  
- Event Handling & Forms  
- API Integration & Full-Stack Development  
- Routing & State Management  

This repository documents my **daily learning, experiments, and projects**.
